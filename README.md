## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for anyone aspiring to become proficient in software development and computer science.

## Data Structures

### Linked List

The linked list implementation includes singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Stack

The stack data structure implementation includes basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

### Queue

The queue data structure implementation includes basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

Various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort are implemented.

### Search Algorithms

Common search algorithms such as linear search, binary search, and depth-first search (DFS) are implemented.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures or algorithms implemented in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and utilize the JavaScript files accordingly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanritesh94/java-script-link-list.git
